### Goal Factoring Script
Command-Line only. Runs in Python 3. Start by writing down your goals, and then leave the input blank for when you want to go down a level. After you've given input for every goal you get the option to export to an Org-Mode file or .GML (for yED; it won't have a layout by default so if it looks bugged just run one and it'll be OK).
